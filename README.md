## Installation

* Drag the `YSStatusBar/YSStatusBar` folder into your project.
* Add #include "YSStatusBar.h" to your .pch file


## Usage

YSStatusBar is a singleton. Make sure your view displays the default status bar
for this to be effective. I defaulted the colors to match defalut. Change if
needed.


### Showing the Status Message

* [YSStatusBar showWithStatus:@"text message..."];
* [YSStatusBar setStatus:@"change message..."];

### Hide Status Message

* [YSStatusBar hide];
